      <description>I made a site and published it. The proof is that you&amp;rsquo;re reading this. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do this for a while because I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that having a personal website can be useful, and it turned out to be not too hard. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I did:
  I chose Hugo as a static site generator, because that&amp;rsquo;s what blogdown uses, which I might decide to use some day. If I don&amp;rsquo;t, I might change to jekyll, since it has some nice integrations with github pages.</description>

      <description>This site uses the Hugo-bearblog theme, with some help from blogdown. Maybe some day I&amp;rsquo;ll write a post about how I did it. Enjoy.</description>
