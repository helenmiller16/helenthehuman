I've been thinking a lot recently about the meaning of the word "queer." I consider myself to be queer.
And I have an idea, albiet an evolving one, about what that means to me. Honestly, I'm not sure how other
queer people define the word, because I haven't asked. I'll try to explain my take here. It won't be a 
clear definition because I don't have a clear definition in my mind.
