# About me
I am a Master's student at the University of Washington in the 
[Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management](https://quantitative.uw.edu/) (QERM) program. I am in the 
[Ecosystem Biogeochemistry](https://ecosystembiogeochemistry.org/) lab, and study nutrient and carbon cycling 
in the Lower Mekong Basin (in Southeast Asia). 

I am interested in using computational and statistical tools to understand 
ecosystem processes and manage natural resources. Here are some specific areas of interest and expertise: 

- Satellite remote sensing, especially for water quality
- Ecosystem metabolism in rivers (estimating it using statistical models)
- Spatial and temporal statistics
- Modeling forest dynamics 

Email me if you want to talk with me about QERM or any of those things or anything else really!

This site uses the Hugo-bearblog theme. I wrote a [blog post](/how-i-made-it/) about how I set it up if you want to know.
